A weighed least squares procedure is used to generate\r\nthe fit to simultaneously optimize the reproduction of adiabatic energies and energy gradients and the diabaticity of\r\nthe quasi-diabaticrepresentation, defined by the residual coupling between diabatic states.  Lagrange multipliers are\r\nused to enable the exact reproduction of arbitrary selected set of data, such as energy and gradients at critical\r\npoints on the potential or energy difference and derivative couplings at points of conical intersections.\r\n\r\n### Nonadiabatic couplings and Seams of Conical Intersections\r\n\r\nThe **H**d approach is capable of extremely accurate description of nonadiabatic interactions.  It has been used to \r\nsuccessfully describe large portions of the seam of [conical intersections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_intersection), spanning completely different \r\ngeometrically structures.  This is enabled by the application of intersection adapted coordinates.\r\n\r\n### Flexibility\r\n              \r\nThe program allows the user to define the blocks of the matrix **H**d with a large set of customizable basis functions,\r\nenabling the flexibility to describe complex features on the surface to a high level of accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Global Symmetry Treatment\r\n\r\nProjection operator method is used to allow the program to use an arbitrary subgroup of the Complete Nuclear \r\nPermutation Inversion group to construct symmetry adapted basis for the fitting procedure.  With the help of \r\nsuch feature, the program can correctly treat the symmetry in problems that involve large amplitude motions, \r\nas well as vibrational problems.\r\n\r\n### Efficiency\r\n\r\nWith the fully analytical form of Hd, the evaluation time for a single point is usually within 50ms. Future \r\nupdate is planned to allow vectorized evaluation of large number of data points.  The fitting program achieve \r\nhigh efficiency through the extensive use of optimized and threaded LAPACK and BLAS libraries.   Other \r\nfunctionalities such as automatic local internal coordinate construction, automatic null space removal and \r\nGDIIS extrapolations provide tools to enhance performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Authors\r\n\r\nsurfgen is created by [Xiaolei Zhu](http://www.linkedin.com/in/virtualzx) and \r\n[other awesome members](http://www.jhu.edu/~chem/yarkony/group.html)\r\nfrom [Yarkony Group](http://www.jhu.edu/~chem/yarkony/), Department of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University\r\n\r\nThis program is based on, and would not have been possible without the quadratic Hd fitting program \r\nfor vibrational spectroscopy simulation, developed by \r\n[Michael Schuurman](ca.linkedin.com/pub/michael-schuurman/7/996/32), then also a member of Yarkony group.\r\n\r\n\r\n# References\r\n  \r\nXiaolei Zhu and David Yarkony, *Toward eliminating the electronic structure bottleneck in* \r\n*nonadiabatic dynamics on the fly: An algorithm to fit nonlocal, quasidiabatic, coupled* \r\n*electronic state Hamiltonians based on ab initio electronic structure data* ,\r\n[*J.
