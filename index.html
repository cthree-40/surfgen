        <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>surfgen use <em>ab initio</em> data to generate analytical coupled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy_surface">potential energy surfaces(PES)</a> using quasi-diabatic Hamiltonians( <strong>H</strong>d ).<br>
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a way to accelerate quantum mechanical 
simulations of non-adiabatic chemical processes without compromising the accuracy of 
expensive quantum chemical electronic structure methods required for non-adiabatic processes.</p>

<p>This project is coded with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran_90#Fortran_90">Fortran 90</a> 
and contains both fitting programs used to generate coupled PESs and evaluation libraries 
that can be conveniently used to utilize the fit surface in any simulation program.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<h3>Fitting Ab Initio Data</h3>

<p>The program is capable of fitting energy, energy gradient and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibronic_coupling">derivative coupling</a> (AKA nonadiabatic coupling or
vibronic coupling) data obtained from ab initio calculations.  A weighed least squares procedure is used to generate
the fit to simultaneously optimize the reproduction of adiabatic energies and energy gradients and the diabaticity of
the quasi-diabaticrepresentation, defined by the residual coupling between diabatic states.  Lagrange multipliers are
used to enable the exact reproduction of arbitrary selected set of data, such as energy and gradients at critical
points on the potential or energy difference and derivative couplings at points of conical intersections.</p>

<h3>Nonadiabatic couplings and Seams of Conical Intersections</h3>

<p>The <strong>H</strong>d approach is capable of extremely accurate description of nonadiabatic interactions.  It has been used to 
successfully describe large portions of the seam of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conical_intersection">conical intersections</a>, spanning completely different 
geometrically structures.  This is enabled by the application of intersection adapted coordinates.</p>

<h3>Flexibility</h3>

<p>The program allows the user to define the blocks of the matrix <strong>H</strong>d with a large set of customizable basis functions,
enabling the flexibility to describe complex features on the surface to a high level of accuracy.</p>

<h3>Global Symmetry Treatment</h3>

<p>Projection operator method is used to allow the program to use an arbitrary subgroup of the Complete Nuclear 
Permutation Inversion group to construct symmetry adapted basis for the fitting procedure.  With the help of 
such feature, the program can correctly treat the symmetry in problems that involve large amplitude motions, 
as well as vibrational problems.</p>

<h3>Efficiency</h3>

<p>With the fully analytical form of Hd, the evaluation time for a single point is usually within 50ms. Future 
update is planned to allow vectorized evaluation of large number of data points.  The fitting program achieve 
high efficiency through the extensive use of optimized and threaded LAPACK and BLAS libraries.   Other 
functionalities such as automatic local internal coordinate construction, automatic null space removal and 
GDIIS extrapolations provide tools to enhance performance.</p>

<p>This program is based on, and would not have been possible without the quadratic Hd fitting program 
for vibrational spectroscopy simulation, developed by
